- **Strict TypeScript**: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled for enhanced type safety. Avoid using `any` types.
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain "why" behind the code. Never delete comments -- even commented-out code -- unless you are certain they are incorrect or useless.
- **Function definitions**: Prefer arrow functions for function definitions.
