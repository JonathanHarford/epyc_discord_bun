## Use

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## TODO

Consider:

* Do we need a player model?
* How do we keep one player from initiating lots of games?
* status should say if turn is pending (put in script)
* 

## STATUS

[x] The bot runs and replies to commands. X
[x] Let's make it so that `/play` creates a game with a turn. X
[x] Move the prisma calls to functions. Better yet, models.
