Here is an example of a game administered by epyc-bot and played by Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dmitri. All epyc-bot messages are ephemeral unless stated otherwise. Messages with "->" are to a specific person or channel.

Alice: /help
epyc-bot: Eat Poop You Cat! The first player writes a sentence, the second player draws a picture of that sentence, the third player writes a sentence of that picture, and so on. At the end of the game, it gets posted to #epyc where players can admire the art, the writing, and how the concept mutated. When providing an initiating sentence, input something that will be visually interesting! Type `/play` or `/status`.
